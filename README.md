# Life of the Party

[Life of the Party](https://life-of-the-party.herokuapp.com/) is a simple drinking game.

You have up to three guesses to make:

- One card is drawn face down. Is it red or black?
- If you guess correctly, a second card is drawn face down. Is this card higher or lower than the first card?
- If you guess correctly, a third card is drawn face down. Is that card inside or outside the two previous cards?

If you guess any of these incorrectly, take a drink and move onto the next player.

This app uses:

- [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com). This is a public API that allows a client to retrieve and utilise a deck of cards.
- React
- Express
- Knex.js (SQL)
- Custom CSS
- Node.js

This was a group project at [Enspiral Dev Academy](https://devacademy.co.nz/), built in just 2 days by:

- [Ben Means](https://github.com/benjamin-means)
- [Fai Songprasit](https://github.com/fai-songprasit)
- [Jefferson Matumba](https://github.com/JeffersonMat)
- [Joe Butler](https://github.com/josef-butler)

It was a fun project with a lot of business logic under the hood! Given more time we would have liked to refactor the code to make it much cleaner.

## Have a play

The game is available to play [here](https://life-of-the-party.herokuapp.com/).
